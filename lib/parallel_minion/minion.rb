    # Create a new Minion
    #
    #   Creates a new thread and logs the time for the supplied block to complete processing.
    #   The exception without stack trace is logged whenever an exception is thrown in the thread.
    #
    #   Re-raises any unhandled exception in the calling thread when `#result` is called.
    #   Copies the logging tags and specified ActiveRecord scopes to the new thread.
    #
    # Parameters
    #   *arguments
    #     Any number of arguments can be supplied that are passed into the block
    #     in the order they are listed.
    #
    #     Note:
    #       All arguments must be supplied by copy and not by reference.
    #       For example, use `#dup` to create copies of passed data.
    #       Pass by copy is critical to prevent concurrency issues when multiple threads
    #       attempt to update the same object at the same time.
    #
    #   Proc / lambda
    #     A block of code must be supplied that the Minion will execute.
    #
    #     Note:
    #       This block will be executed within the scope of the created minion instance
    #       and _not_ within the scope of where the Proc/lambda was originally created.
    #       This is done to force all parameters to be passed in explicitly
    #       and should be read-only or duplicates of the original data.
    #
    #   :description [String]
    #     Description for this task that the Minion is performing.
    #     Written to the log file along with the time take to complete the task.
    #
    #   :timeout [Integer]
    #     Maximum amount of time in milli-seconds that the task may take to complete
    #     before #result times out.
    #     Set to 0 to give the thread an infinite amount of time to complete.
    #     Default: 0 ( Wait forever )
    #
    #     Notes:
    #     - :timeout does not affect what happens to the Minion running the
    #       the task, it only affects how long #result will take to return.
    #     - The Minion will continue to run even after the timeout has been exceeded
    #     - If :enabled is false, or ParallelMinion::Minion.enabled is false,
    #       then :timeout is ignored and assumed to be Minion::INFINITE
    #       since the code is run in the calling thread when the Minion is created
    #
    #   :on_timeout [Exception]
    #     The class to raise on the minion when the minion times out.
    #     By raising the exception on the running thread it ensures that the thread
    #     ends due to the exception, rather than continuing to execute.
    #     The exception is only raised on the running minion when #result is called.
    #     The current call to #result will complete with a result of nil, future
    #     calls to #result will raise the supplied exception on the current thread
    #     since the thread will have terminated with that exception.
    #
    #     Note: :on_timeout has no effect if not #enabled?
    #
    #   :metric [String]
    #     Name of the metric to forward to Semantic Logger when measuring the minion execution time.
    #     Example: inquiry/address_cleansing
    #
    #     When a metric is supplied the following metrics will also be generated:
    #     - wait
    #         Duration waiting for a minion to complete.
    #
    #     The additional metrics are added to the supplied metric name. For example:
    #     - inquiry/address_cleansing/wait
    #
    #   :log_exception [Symbol]
    #     Control whether or how an exception thrown in the block is
    #     reported by Semantic Logger. Values:
    #      :full
    #        Log the exception class, message, and backtrace
    #      :partial
    #        Log the exception class and message. The backtrace will not be logged
    #      :off
    #        Any unhandled exception raised in the block will not be logged
    #      Default: :partial
    #
    #   :on_exception_level [:trace | :debug | :info | :warn | :error | :fatal]
    #     Override the log level only when an exception occurs.
    #     Default: ParallelMinion::Minion.completed_log_level
    #
    #   :enabled [Boolean]
    #     Override the global setting: `ParallelMinion::Minion.enabled?` for this minion instance.
    #
    # The overhead for moving the task to a Minion (separate thread) vs running it
    # sequentially is about 0.3 ms if performing other tasks in-between starting
    # the task and requesting its result.
    #
    # The following call adds 0.5 ms to total processing time vs running the
    # code in-line:
    #   ParallelMinion::Minion.new(description: 'Count', timeout: 5) { 1 }.result
    #
    # Note:
    #   On JRuby it is recommended to add the following setting to .jrubyrc
    #     thread.pool.enabled=true
    #
    # Example:
    #   ParallelMinion::Minion.new(
    #     10.days.ago,
    #     description: 'Doing something else in parallel',
    #     timeout:     1000
    #   ) do |date|
    #     MyTable.where('created_at <= ?', date).count
    #   end
    #
    # Example, when the result is being ignored, log full exception as an error:
    #   ParallelMinion::Minion.new(
    #     customer,
    #     description:        "We don't care about the result",
    #     log_exception:      :full,
    #     on_exception_level: :error
    #   ) do |customer|
    #     customer.save!
    #   end
