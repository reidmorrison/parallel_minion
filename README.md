Wrap Ruby code with a minion so that it is run on a parallel thread.

## Description

Parallel Minion allows you to take existing blocks of code and wrap them in a minion
so that they can run asynchronously in a separate thread.
The minion then passes back the result to the caller when or if requested.
If any exceptions were thrown during the minion processing, it will be re-raised
in the callers thread so that no additional work needs to be done when converting
existing code to use minions.

## Example

```ruby
minion = ParallelMinion::Minion.new(
  10.days.ago,
  description: 'Doing something else in parallel',
  timeout:     1000
) do |date|
  MyTable.where('created_at <= ?', date).count
end

# Do other work here...

# Retrieve the result of the minion
count = minion.result

puts "Found #{count} records"
```

## Documentation

## Production Use

Parallel Minion is being used in a high performance, highly concurrent
production environment running JRuby with Ruby on Rails on a Puma web server.
Significant reduction in the time it takes to complete rails request processing
has been achieved by moving existing blocks of code into Minions.
